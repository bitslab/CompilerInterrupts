Kmeans Example Application Readme
Last revised 15th April 2007


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The kmeans applications groups several n-dimensional datapoints into a 
user-specified number of groups using an iterative process, and finds the mean
value of each group.


2. Provided Files
-----------------

kmeans.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
kmeans-seq.c: The sequential version of the application
kmeans-pthread.c: The pthread version of the application
stddefines.h: Contains declarations of commonly used functions and constants
MapReduceScheduler.c/h: The MapReduce engine used by the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./kmeans -d <vector dimension> -c <num clusters> -p <num points> -s <max value>
./kmeans-pthread -d <vector dimension> -c <num clusters> -p <num points> -s <max value>
./kmeans-seq -d <vector dimension> -c <num clusters> -p <num points> -s <max value>

runs the MapReduce, Pthreads and sequential version of the application
respectively
