PCA Example Application Readme
Last revised 15th April 2007


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The PCA application computes the mean vector and covariance matrix for a 
randomly generated matrix, which is the first step in performing principal 
component analysis. 


2. Provided Files
-----------------

pca.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
pca-seq.c: The sequential version of the application
pca-pthread.c: The pthread version of the application
stddefines.h: Contains declarations of commonly used functions and constants
MapReduceScheduler.c/h: The MapReduce engine used by the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./pca -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>
./pca-pthread -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>
./pca-seq -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>

runs the MapReduce, Pthreads and sequential version of the application
respectively
