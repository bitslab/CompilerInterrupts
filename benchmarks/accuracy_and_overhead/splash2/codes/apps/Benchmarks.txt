This file describes the procedures & files required for different experiments with splash2

1. Performance (runtime duration) over #Threads
experiment script: perf_test_over_threads.sh (any clock, pinned* or unpinned mode)
plot script: plot_bar_chart_splash2.sh per thread, plot_line_splash2.sh per benchmark

2. Performance (runtime duration) over Allowed Deviation
experiment script: perf_test_over_allowed_dev.sh for pinned mode, perf_test_over_allowed_dev_without_fiber.sh (old file, may need updating) unpinned mode, without libfiber
plot script: plot_bench_stats.sh?

3. Performance (runtime duration) over Push Interval
experiment script: perf_test_over_push_intv.sh for pinned mode
plot script: plot_bench_stats.sh?

4. Average interval accuracy over Allowed Deviation
experiment script: perf_test_over_allowed_dev.sh for pinned mode
plot script: plot_bench_stats.sh
plot func: plot_ad, plot_ad_basic. Use magnified=1, to magnify the plot

5. Average interval accuracy over Push Interval
experiment script: perf_test_over_push_intv.sh for pinned mode & define INTV_STATS in CompilerInterrupt.h
plot script: plot_bench_stats.sh
plot func: plot_pi, plot_pi_basic. Use magnified=1, to magnify the plot

6. Overall interval accuracy (over time & CDF)
experiment script: perf_test_over_allowed_dev.sh for pinned mode & define INTV_STATS in CompilerInterrupt.h
conversion script: convert_to_cdf.sh to convert distribution data to cdf
plot script: plot_cdf_tsc.sh for cdf, plot_pushseq_vs_intvic.sh & plot_pushseq_vs_intvtsc.sh for overall distribution over timeline, plot_pushintv_vs_intvtsc.sh for IR inst vs timestamp plot

7. Comparison of performance between software instruction counter & hardware performance counters
experiment script: perf_test_vs_papi.sh
plot script: plot_vs_papi.sh

*pinned mode stands for tests for cooperative multitasking, where multiple threads are run on single core, or multiple fibers on single thread

NOTE: All legacy data files for the first draft of evaluation, including scripts for plots are stored in backup_stats

NOTE: PAPI based interrupt mode is not enabled for fiber based implementations
