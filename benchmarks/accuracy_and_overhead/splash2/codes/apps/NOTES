1. Makefile.lc, Makefile.orig files are deprecated & Makefile.init is the new integrated makefile for both the original program & the one with logical clock. Remove the files later.
2. LLVM build path is hardcoded in this directory's Makefiles. Change them if needed. 
3. The fiber mode is configured to run with 1 thread always. Change the fiber_manager_init() call arguments to change this.
